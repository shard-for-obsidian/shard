# Notebook Navigator

Notebook Navigator reimagines the file exploration experience in Obsidian with a powerful two-pane interface that puts navigation and file management front and center. The plugin replaces the default file explorer with an enhanced view that combines a traditional folder tree with tag-based browsing, giving you multiple pathways to discover and organize your notes.

Built for efficiency and ease of use, Notebook Navigator includes file previews, full keyboard navigation, drag-and-drop support, and the ability to pin frequently accessed notes. With customizable display options and a clean, intuitive interface, it transforms your vault into a well-organized digital notebook where finding and managing content becomes a seamless part of your workflow.
