This plugin replaces the default file explorer in Obsidian with a clean two-pane interface. The left pane features a folder tree and tag browser, while the right pane provides file previews. It supports keyboard navigation, drag-and-drop functionality, pinned notes, and customizable display options to enhance your note organization and navigation experience.
