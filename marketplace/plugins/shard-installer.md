# Shard Installer

Shard Installer brings a modern plugin distribution system to Obsidian. Built on the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards and GitHub Container Registry, it enables seamless discovery and installation of Obsidian plugins from containerized repositories.

With Shard Installer, plugin developers can publish their work using familiar container workflows, while users benefit from reliable version management, automated updates, and a curated marketplace experience. The plugin integrates directly into Obsidian's settings interface, providing a clean browsing experience with detailed metadata, version history, and one-click installation.
