# Natural Language Dates

Natural Language Dates transforms how you work with dates in Obsidian by allowing you to create date-links using everyday language. Simply type phrases like "next Friday," "in two weeks," or "last month," and the plugin automatically converts them into properly formatted date links.

This plugin is perfect for daily notes, task management, and journaling workflows. It supports a wide range of natural language expressions and can be customized to match your preferred date formats and linking styles, making temporal navigation in your vault effortless and intuitive.
