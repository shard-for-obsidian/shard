# Obsidian Community Plugin Specification

This repository contains a specification for Obsidian plugins that are hosted on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). It includes TypeScript types, utility functions, and examples to help developers create and manage Obsidian plugins using GHCR as the distribution platform.

## Motivation

- Lack of visibility into the current obsidian plugin distribution.
- GitHub Releases are not ideal for distributing plugins since their contents are not immutable.
- GHCR provides a more robust and reliable way to distribute plugins with versioning and immutability.
- Lack of review in plugin updates.
